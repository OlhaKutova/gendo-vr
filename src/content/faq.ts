      question: "What is Gendo VR?",
      answer: "A VR mode that lets users step inside their Gendo-generated scenes at full scale for spatial review and client walkthroughs."
    },
    {
      question: "How does it work with my current workflow?",
      answer: "You generate scenes in Gendo, then launch VR from the project. Any notes or snapshots you make in VR sync back to your Gendo file."
    },
    {
      question: "What hardware is supported?",
      answer: "Modern consumer VR headsets. Candidates can assume a standard WebXR-compatible device for the purposes of the task."
    },

    },
    {
      question: "Can I adjust materials or design elements in VR?",
      answer: "V1 supports navigation, scale adjustments and viewing scenes. Advanced editing is not required for this task."
    },

      question: "Can I present VR scenes to clients?",
      answer: "Yes. VR mode is designed for simple, guided client walkthroughs."

    },
    {
      question: "Does VR replace the normal Gendo interface?",
      answer: "No. VR is an optional review mode that complements standard 2D/3D workflows."
    },
    {
      question: "When will Gendo VR be available?",
      answer: "This is a fictional feature for the assignment. Candidates should treat it as already available for marketing purposes."
